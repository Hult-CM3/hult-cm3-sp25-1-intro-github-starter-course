While I was doing this assignment I had some issues, I got left behind during class as I had some issues in creating my account. I also felt that the class was very fast paced, so I had some issues catching up. I had to rely on my classmate’s notes to guide myself while doing the assignment, and with the help of the CS50 duck, I managed to finish the assignment. However, I plan on looking up videos to guide me throughout the course. Apart from that, I learned about GitHub and how the terminal affects the code I’ve written. I had a small idea of what python was but I had never heard of terminals or how rm, cd, and those terms work.
