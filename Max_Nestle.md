At the start it was a little difficult to get into how it all worked but after a little time and all of the given information I got more easier. What helped me alot 
during this was my prior expirience from school where I did scratch and another language model. Therefore it was fun to finally be able to work with it again and im 
hoping I will learn even more in the future.
