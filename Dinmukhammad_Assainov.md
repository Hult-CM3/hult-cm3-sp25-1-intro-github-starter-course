Several years ago I had an experience of knowing HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MySQL on amateur level (I was into web-design). However, I forgot the most of those knowledge. 
In comparison to the languages mentioned before Python feels much more convenient and simplified, I suppose that I would like it much more eventually.
Looking forwatd to learn more in future CS and BAN classes.
