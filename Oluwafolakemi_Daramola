I learned how to make loops, compare items using python most especially in the past days
I have self-taught myself coding before this but i never got to practice or challenge myslef the way this course has already started. I'm still confused on what the right loops to use are
Like the if-else or the while loop. I'm still trying very hard to visualize my codes by using scratch. It has allowed me to understand what i'm doing much easier.
