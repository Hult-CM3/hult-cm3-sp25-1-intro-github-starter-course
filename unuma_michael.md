For me, I would say that the most challenging thing was starting and figuring out what to begin the program with. I didn't know what the python script would contain. But I was sure of the basics to put into my terminal. I made a lot of errors along the way in terms of running the script, and I had to research how to run it. I didn’t quite understand how it would look—whether it would be a game or something I could run on the back end like on Scratch. However, I was happy to eventually see the hashtags, like in the assignment instructions on Canvas. I also encountered some issues with the directory. For example, using cd .. enables you to move back one directory, but I needed to move forward into the mario.py file. After some errors, I researched how to do that and learned how to navigate folders and files effectively. This helped me start well. From there, I did the testing, and most of the code I learned came from trial and error and YouTube.
