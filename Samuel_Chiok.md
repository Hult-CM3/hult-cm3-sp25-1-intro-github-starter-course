### I understood the first few basic lines of code, but I am still confused about loops. I have had some basic beginner experience on coding with other languages which are javascript and C++, but I no longer have any recollection on any of the coding that I had done. I have created a google doc for myself that contains the most recently learned lines of code and commands, but with the recorded notes it was not enough to assist me in making the mario pyramid.
