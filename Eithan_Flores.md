I'm very confused about the understanding of GitHub and programming. It's a subject that interests me greatly, knowing how it has become very integral in helping collaboration, building projects, and keeping up with today's world. I always found it amazing how powerful these tools could potentially be, but every time I try to explore it, I get lost in its intricacy.

What has been especially difficult is learning through videos and written tutorials. The reason is that the resources indeed explain the concept, but more often than not, I fail to connect the dots between theory and practice. GitHub feels like an endless maze of commands, branches, and repositories that I just can't seem to wrap my head around. Programming, in all its forms, with all the different languages and their syntax rules, seems to be learning a whole new way of thinking.
